Stage 2: Develop the Web Admin Dashboard (React)
## Project Setup

- Initialize a new React project using create-react-app or Vite.
- Set up routing with React Router for admin sections (e.g., Orders, Customers, Menu Management).
- Install UI component libraries like Material UI or Ant Design for a professional look and faster UI development.
- Core Features for Admin Dashboard

## Authentication and Role Management: 
- Create a login page and integrate PocketBase authentication.
- Order Management: Create a page to view, update, and filter orders. Show order status, customer details, and driver assignment.
- Menu Management: Allow admins to add, update, and delete menu items with form validation.
- Customer Management: Provide access to customer profiles and order history.
- Analytics and Reports: Set up basic analytics (e.g., total sales, most popular items) using a charting library like Chart.js.
- Integrate API with PocketBase

## Connect the dashboard to PocketBase APIs to pull and push data for each page.
- Use React Query to manage data fetching, caching, and synchronization with PocketBase
